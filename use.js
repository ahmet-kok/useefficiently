Leo demonstrated exceptional proficiency as a full-stack developer, especially in working with APIs and developing intricate automations. His approach to testing, analysis, and selection of third-party services and APIs was both meticulous and strategic. Working with Ahmet was a genuinely positive experience, and we got the job done together where im sure other freelancers would have given up or started asking about additional fees and so on.",

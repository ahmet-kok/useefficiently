## Features

- **User Registration:** New users can create accounts by providing their necessary information, such as username, email,nÄ±ckname and password. The registration process includes validation checks to ensure data accuracy.

- **User Login:** Registered users can log in using their credentials. The application employs robust security measures, such as password hashing and encryption, to protect user data.

## Installation and Usage

### Getting Started

#### 1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

#### 2. Install npm packages, react-icons, NextAuth, mongoose, bcryptjs

```bash
/* open terminal */
> cd my-app //first
> npm i  //second
> npm i   next-auth, mongoose, bcryptjs //third
```

#### 3. Configure the [open an .env file at my-app directory write

MONGODB_URI = Create your MongoDB project and cluster and database> connect > connect for visual studio
<your cluster name>
NEXTAUTH_SECRET = I wrote chracters randomly long and meaning does not matters.
NEXTAUTH_URL = http://localhost:3000 for use on your local
]. 4. Run the application using cd my-app > npm run dev

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# What I learned

This is a fullstack task but I am not (just planning to be ðŸ˜…) also my first contact with the backend, so good for me ðŸŽ‰

- I learned how to use Postman to testing my http request
- I learned usage of MongoDb and implementation to project
- I learned writing basic endpoints
- I learned nextAuth at enterance level
- I gained experience using tailwind
- I learned how websites works (bakcand sides)

# What I could not learn and I should learn

- I could not map user nickname because I could not use callbacks. here is some source for this issue. I will solve this problem.

https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/callbacks#session-callback
https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/2385

- I could not use access token because of this I cold not get it together with my product management page. I will solve this problem.

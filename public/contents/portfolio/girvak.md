# My Big Markdown File

## Introduction

Welcome to my big markdown file! In this file, you will find a variety of content types to help you explore the capabilities of markdown.

## Table of Contents

1. [Headers](#headers)
2. [Lists](#lists)
3. [Links](#links)
4. [Images](#images)
5. [Code Blocks](#code-blocks)
6. [Tables](#tables)
7. [Emphasis](#emphasis)
8. [Blockquotes](#blockquotes)

## Headers

Headers allow you to structure your content with different levels of importance. Here's an example:

### Level 3 Header

## Lists

Lists are a great way to organize information. Here's an example of an ordered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

And here's an example of an unordered list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

## Links

Links allow you to reference external resources. Here's an example of a link:

[GitHub](https://github.com)

## Images

Images can be embedded in markdown files. Here's an example:

![GitHub Logo](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png)

## Code Blocks

Code blocks are useful for displaying code snippets. Here's an example:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")

hello_world()
```

## Tables

Tables can be used to present tabular data. Here's an example:

| Name  | Age | Country |
|-------|-----|---------|
| John  | 25  | USA     |
| Emily | 30  | Canada  |
| Mark  | 28  | UK      |

## Emphasis

You can add emphasis to your text using bold and italic styles. Here's an example:

**Bold text** and *italic text*

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are used to highlight quoted text. Here's an example:

> "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." - Steve Jobs

That's it for my big markdown file! I hope you found it helpful.
